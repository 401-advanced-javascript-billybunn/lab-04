/*
- Using only buffers and bit manipulation, generate a file in the files folder called loop.js that initiates an array with 3 people's names, iterates them with a forEach loop, and console.log's each value.

- You may not use Buffer.from() to simply create a buffer from chunks of your target code. Rather, you will need to work character by character.

- Verify your work by running node loop.js from within the files folder and seeing the array items printed out.
